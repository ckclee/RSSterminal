# RSSterminal
RSS Reader in Terminal
Let's build an RSS feed reader! Most news websites, blogs, podcasts, maintain a RSS feed which gives real-time content updates. You'll build a tool for fetching and converting the feed with a given RSS feed URL.

## Requirements
The user can input a RSS feed URL.
The reader will display the title, description, and link of the original content.

## Tech/framework used
Built with Python3

## How to use
1. You'll need to install the feedparser library by running pip:
$ pip install feedparser

2. Run RSSterminal:
$ python3 RSSterminal.py

For an extra challenge

The user can add more than one RSS feed URL.
Instead of using a RSS parser library, build the parser yourself!
